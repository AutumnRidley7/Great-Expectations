Quiz 1: SDEV 143 Module 1 
My dream job is to work as a video game developer, ideally contributing to
story-driven or simulation-based games such as those created by Quantic Dream
or the Sims team at EA. This career appeals to me because it combines
programming, creativity, and interactive storytelling into one field. 
I enjoy problem-solving through code while also designing experiences that
emotionally engage players. Video game development allows me to apply my
software development skills in a creative way, turning ideas into immersive
worlds and meaningful player choices. This role represents my long-term goal of building impactful, well-designed
games while continuing to grow as a programmer and creative thinker.
